    <h2>Trev</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! I'm Trevin Larsen and I am currently a major in Computer Information Technology wanting to head into the cyber-security sector. </p>
    <p>I love to ski as much as possible in the winter. This includes all types from alpine skiing in the resort, to Ski Touring and even cross country skiing on those cold sunny days. I also love working on my car in the summer time. I enjoy building my car to certain specifications I like as it feels like a different car each time you drive it.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church since i was 8 years old. I was blessed to be able to be born into a family that had recieved the gospel earlier which made it easier for me to learn it. I can't wait to start this class and work through problems together.</p>
